## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to ZecretlyClient, from writing code and documentation to reporting bugs and suggesting new features.

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please help us by reporting it! Good bug reports are extremely helpful.

Before submitting a bug report, please:

1.  **Check the [documentation](README.md)** to see if the behavior is intended or if there's a known workaround.
2.  **Search existing [issues](https://github.com/DevAldrete/ZecretlyClient/issues)** to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, add a 👍 reaction to the existing issue and, if you have new information, add a comment.

When submitting a bug report, please include:

*   **A clear and descriptive title.**
*   **Steps to reproduce the bug.** Be as specific as possible.
*   **What you expected to happen.**
*   **What actually happened.** Include screenshots or GIFs if they help illustrate the problem.
*   **Your environment:**
    *   ZecretlyClient version (if applicable).
    *   Operating System and version.
    *   Any relevant browser or Node.js versions.
*   **Any error messages or stack traces.**

You can submit bug reports by opening a new issue on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/DevAldrete/ZecretlyClient/issues).

### Suggesting Enhancements or New Features

We welcome suggestions for enhancements and new features!

Before submitting a suggestion:

1.  **Check the [Roadmap](README.md#️-roadmap)** in the README to see if your idea is already planned.
2.  **Search existing [issues](https://github.com/DevAldrete/ZecretlyClient/issues)** to see if someone else has already suggested it. If so, add a 👍 reaction and consider contributing to the discussion.

When submitting a suggestion, please include:

*   **A clear and descriptive title.**
*   **A detailed description of the proposed enhancement or feature.** Explain the problem it solves or the value it adds.
*   **Any potential use cases or examples.**
*   **(Optional) Mockups or design ideas.**

You can submit suggestions by opening a new issue on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/DevAldrete/ZecretlyClient/issues) with the "enhancement" or "feature request" label.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to ZecretlyClient? You can start by looking through `good first issue` or `help wanted` issues:

*   [Good first issues](https://github.com/DevAldrete/ZecretlyClient/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
*   [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/DevAldrete/ZecretlyClient/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

If you're new to open source, these are great places to start! Feel free to ask questions if you get stuck.

### Pull Requests

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork locally:** `git clone https://github.com/DevAldrete/ZecretlyClient.git`

4.  **Make your changes.** Ensure you follow the [Style Guides](#style-guides) and add [Tests](#testing) for your changes.
5.  **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message (see [Git Commit Messages](#git-commit-messages)).
6.  **Push your changes** to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
7.  **Open a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original `ZecretlyClient` repository.
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR.
    *   Reference any related issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
    *   Explain the changes you've made and why.
    *   Ensure all automated checks (CI/CD) pass.

Project maintainers will review your PR. We may ask for changes or provide feedback. Please be responsive to comments and questions.

## Development Setup

*(This section will need to be filled in once your project structure and build process are more defined. Here's a placeholder.)*

To set up ZecretlyClient for local development:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (specify version, e.g., >= 18.x)
    *   npm or yarn
    *   Docker (for PostgreSQL)

    # or
    yarn install
    ```
4.  **Set up the database:**
    *   Ensure Docker is running.
    *   Run `docker-compose up -d` (you'll need a `docker-compose.yml` file for PostgreSQL).
    *   Run database migrations: `npm run migrate` (or your specific command).
5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

Please refer to the main `README.md` for more detailed setup instructions if available.

## Style Guides

Consistency is key! Please adhere to the following style guides.

### Git Commit Messages

*   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
*   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
*   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
*   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
*   Consider using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for more structured commit messages, e.g.:
    *   `feat: add user authentication module`
    *   `fix: resolve issue with request timeout`
    *   `docs: update contribution guidelines`
    *   `style: format code with Prettier`
    *   `refactor: simplify response parsing logic`
    *   `test: add unit tests for environment variables`
    *   `chore: update dependencies`

### JavaScript/TypeScript Style Guide

*   We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Please ensure your code is formatted with Prettier before committing. You can set up Prettier to run on save in your editor or use a pre-commit hook.
*   Follow standard TypeScript best practices (e.g., strong typing, interfaces, enums where appropriate).
*   Linting rules (e.g., ESLint) will be enforced. (You'll need to set up ESLint).

### React Style Guide

*   Use functional components with Hooks.
*   Follow common React best practices for component structure, state management, and props.
*   (Add more specific React guidelines as your project develops, e.g., naming conventions, component organization).

## Testing

*   All new features should include relevant unit tests.
*   Bug fixes should include a test that reproduces the bug and verifies the fix.
*   Integration tests and end-to-end tests will be added as the project matures.
*   We aim for high test coverage. Please run `npm test` (or your test command) before submitting a PR.

*(Specify your testing framework, e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, Vitest)*

## Documentation

*   Code should be well-commented, especially for complex logic.
*   Public APIs and components should have clear JSDoc/TSDoc comments.
*   If your contribution changes user-facing functionality, please update the relevant sections of the `README.md` or other documentation files.

## Community and Communication

*   **GitHub Issues:** For bug reports, feature requests, and discussions related to specific tasks.
*   **GitHub Discussions:** (Consider enabling this) For broader discussions, Q&A, and sharing ideas.
*   **(Optional) Discord/Slack Server:** For real-time chat and community building. (Link here if you create one).

Please be respectful and constructive in all communications.

## Recognition

We appreciate all contributions, big or small! All contributors will be acknowledged. (Consider adding a contributors section to your README or a separate file, perhaps automated with a tool like `all-contributors`).
