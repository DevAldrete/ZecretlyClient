**ZecretlyClient (or Zecretly for short) is a next-generation API client designed to be blazingly fast, completely secure, and incredibly easy to use. We're building Zecretly to be open source and free forever under the GPLv3 license, addressing the common pain points found in existing API clients like Postman, Yaak, and Bruno.**

Our mission is to provide developers with a delightful and efficient tool for interacting with APIs, streamlining workflows, and boosting productivity.

## ‚ú® Why Zecretly?

We believe that interacting with APIs shouldn't be a cumbersome or frustrating experience. Existing tools often suffer from:

*   **Performance Issues:** Slow startup times and laggy interfaces. [39]
*   **Bloat:** Overloaded with features that many users don't need, leading to a clunky experience. [39, 48]
*   **Steep Learning Curves:** Complex UIs that are difficult to navigate.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** Cloud-syncing by default or unclear data handling practices. [6, 47]
*   **Version Control Difficulties:** Proprietary formats that make collaboration and versioning a hassle. [39]
*   **Cost:** Essential features locked behind paywalls. [39, 40]

**Zecretly aims to fix this.** We're focusing on:

*   üöÄ **Blazing Performance:** Built with modern technologies for a snappy and responsive experience.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Complete Security & Privacy:** Local-first approach. Your data stays with you. No mandatory cloud sync. [6, 30]
*   üòå **Ease of Use:** An intuitive and clean user interface that's easy to learn and a joy to use.
*   ‚ö° **Quick & Efficient:** Streamlined workflows to help you get things done faster.
*   üåê **Open Source & Free Forever:** Community-driven development and accessible to everyone. [20]
*   üîß **Fixing Pain Points:** Directly addressing the frustrations developers face with current tools.

## üöÄ Core Features (Planned & In Progress)

*   **Intuitive Request Creation:** Easily craft HTTP/S requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.). [4]
*   **Environment Variables:** Manage different setups (dev, staging, prod) effortlessly. [23, 30]
*   **Collections & Workspaces:** Organize your API requests logically. [23, 30]
*   **Authentication Helpers:** Simplified setup for common auth methods (Bearer Token, OAuth 2.0, API Keys, Basic Auth). [4, 23]
*   **Response Viewing & Inspection:** Clear and easy-to-understand presentation of headers, body (JSON, XML, HTML, Raw), cookies, and performance metrics. [4]
*   **Code Snippet Generation:** Generate request code in various languages.
*   **History:** Quickly access and re-run previous requests. [4]
*   **Local-First Storage:** All your data is stored locally by default, ensuring privacy and offline access. [6, 30, 39]
*   **Import/Export:** Easily import from and export to common formats (e.g., Postman collections, OpenAPI Spec). [4]
*   **Light & Dark Themes:** Because we care about your eyes.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Planned for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
